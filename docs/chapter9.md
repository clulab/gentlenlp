# Word Similarity and Analogy

This notebook shows how to use pre-trained word embeddings for word similarity and word analogy experiments: [chap09_embeddings](https://github.com/clulab/gentlenlp/blob/main/notebooks/chap09_embeddings.ipynb).

# Text Classification Using Word Embeddings

This notebook implements a feed-forward neural network that uses pre-trained word embeddings as input: [chap09_classification](https://github.com/clulab/gentlenlp/blob/main/notebooks/chap09_classification.ipynb).
